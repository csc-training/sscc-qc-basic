# Spring School on Computational Chemistry Basic QC hands-on

This repository contains hands-on tutorials to be done
using the TmoleX graphical user interface and the TURBOMOLE
engine running on a Puhti. Note, that the latter
requires a license, which is available for academic
users on CSC supercomputers

## [Preparations](./preparations/README.md)

* Setting up TmoleX either via a Browser or by installing it on your own laptop 

## [Tutorial 1](./tutorial1/README.md)

* Use TmoleX to prepare a geometry optimization of a small molecule at DFT level
* Submit the job via TmoleX to Puhti, where the actual calculation is done
* Use TmoleX to monitor the progress of the job
* Use TmoleX to retreive and analyze the results 

## [Tutorial 2](./tutorial2/README.md)

* Multiple geometry optimizations of a number of isomers
* Switch to a higher quality basis set for a single point energy calculation
* Benchmark resource usage by looking at how long the jobs take vs used resources
* Construct your own job template and apply it to a set of molecules
